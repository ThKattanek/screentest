The installation of this program is pretty straightforward:

0. PREREQUISITIES
==============
You will need the following libraries to compile this program:

- GTK+ >= 2.0 (tested on 2.10.13)
- glib >= 2.0 (tested on 2.12.13)

You will need both the libraries (either in static or dynamic form),
and their header files (which may not be installed on your system
by default; for example, check for gtk+-devel, glib-devel and XFree86-devel
packages on Red Hat Linux or Mandrake Linux). This also assumes that the
"pkg-config" command is in your PATH.

The source of screentest is available at the screentest homepage:
    http://screentest.sourceforge.net/

You will also need the ISO C9x-compliant C compiler. This program uses
ISO C9x-style structure initializers, so this is a NECESSARY CONDITION.
You can use for example gcc-3 or later, which is available on most
Unices.

The build process has been tested on Debian unstable (www.debian.org),
but should work on any recent version of UNIX-compatible system.

1. PREPARING THE SOURCES
=========================
Unpack the distribution using the following command:
    tar xvf screentest-<version>.tar.gz
Change the directory to the source directory:
    cd screentest-<version>
Set it up for your system:
    ./configure
You can run "./configure --help" for details of the configuration process.

2. COMPILING THE PROGRAM
========================
Run "make" (On BSD systems, you might want to use "gmake"). This will compile
the "screentest" program. Since the program is mostly standalone, you can now
verify their function by running them in the current directory (calling
"./screentest").

3. INSTALLING
=============
Run "make install".

4a. IF YOU LIKE IT
==================
This program is postcardware. Read the top of the file "COPYING" and send
me a postcard, if you want. Let me know on what system you have tested it,
so I can estimate the userbase and portability of the program.

4b. IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT
========================
Please let me know what can I do for improving screentest. Use the
e-mail <tobias-screentest@23.gs>. If you want to add new modes, see the NEW_TESTS
file for details.

	Hope you find this program useful.
