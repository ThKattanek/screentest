The installation of this program is pretty straightforward:

0. PREREQUISITIES
==============
You will need the following libraries to compile this program:

- GTK+ >= 1.2 (tested on 1.2.10)
- glib >= 1.2 (tested on 1.2.10)

You will need both the libraries (either in static or dynamic form),
and their header files (which may not be installed on your system
by default; for example, check for gtk+-devel, glib-devel and XFree86-devel
packages on Red Hat Linux or Mandrake Linux). This also assumes that the
"gtk-config" command is in your PATH.

The source of screentest is available at the screentest homepage:
    http://www.fi.muni.cz/~kas/screentest/
Alternative location is the author's FTP directory:
    ftp://ftp.linux.cz/pub/linux/people/jan_kasprzak/screentest/

You will also need the ISO C9x-compliant C compiler. This program uses
ISO C9x-style structure initializers, so this is a NECESSARY CONDITION.
You can use for example gcc-2.9x compiler, which is available on most
Unices.

The build process has been tested on Red Hat Linux 7.1 system (www.redhat.com),
but should work on any recent version of UNIX-compatible system.

1a. BUILDING/INSTALLING ON RPM-BASED SYSTEM
=======================================
You will need the rpm-build package installed on your system.
Then (probably as root) run the following command:
    rpm -ta screentest-<version>.tar.gz
If everything works OK, the file
    /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/<arch>/screentest-<version>-<rel>.<arch>.rpm
will be created. Then you can (as root) install it using the following command:
    rpm -Uvh /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/<arch>/screentest-<version>-<rel>.<arch>.rpm
The <arch> is usually "i386", the <rel> is usually "1" and <version> is the
version of this program.

1b. PREPARING THE SOURCES
=========================
Unpack the distribution using the following command:
    zcat screentest-<version>.tar.gz
Change the directory to the source directory:
    cd screentest-<version>
Set it up for your system:
    ./configure
You can run "./configure --help" for details of the configuration process.

2. COMPILING THE PROGRAM
========================
Run "make". This will compile the "screentest" and "screentest.static"
programs. Since the programs are standalone, you can now verify their
function by running them in the current directory ("./screentest" or
"./screentest.static" commands).

3. INSTALLING
=============
Run "make install".

4a. IF YOU LIKE IT
==================
This program is postcardware. Read the top of the file "COPYING" and send
me a postcard, if you want. Let me know on what system you have tested it,
so I can estimate the userbase and portability of the program.

4b. IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT
========================
Please let me know what can I do for improving screentest. Use the
e-mail <kas@fi.muni.cz>. If you want to add new modes, see the NEW_TESTS
file for details.

	Hope you find this program useful.
